## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does `strictly equal` mean?
  strictly equals requires two values to match exactly including the same data type

- What is the logical **and** operator?
  &&; the and operator requires both conditional statements to be true to evaluate as truthy

- Can you name some comparison operators?
  [>, <, ==, >=, <=, ===, != !==]

## Notes

All student notes should be written here.

The logical AND expression is a short-circuit operator. As each operand is converted to a boolean, if the result of one conversion is found to be false, the AND operator stops and returns the original value of that falsy operand; it does not evaluate any of the remaining operands.
